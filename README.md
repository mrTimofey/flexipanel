# Flexipanel

Flexipanel is a set of modules making it very easy to assemble a dashboard UI.

Read [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) to begin. **Full documentation is in WIP**.

Flexipanel will provide you with a highly customizable UI layer. To make things work you have to clarify some things:
- how your backend API works (data protocol, authorization, etc.) - [Setup API](docs/setup-api.md)
- what are the entities you are going to manage (their names, data structure, permissions, etc.)

**Flexipanel is a library and is not ready to use out-of-the-box as it is. You should be familiar with the frontend development to use it. Also it is strongly recommended to use TypeScript, it will really make your life easier :)**
